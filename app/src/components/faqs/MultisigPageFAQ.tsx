    question: "What is a multisig wallet?",
    answer: "A multisig (multi-signature) wallet requires multiple signatures to authorize transactions. This provides enhanced security by requiring approval from multiple parties before funds can be moved."
  },
  {
    id: "how-threshold-works",
    icon: Shield,
    question: "How does the threshold work?",
    answer: "The threshold determines how many signatures are needed to execute a transaction. For example, in a 2-of-3 multisig, any 2 out of the 3 members can authorize transactions. Higher thresholds provide more security but require more coordination."
  },
  {
    id: "public-keys",
    icon: Key,
    question: "What are public keys?",
    answer: "Public keys are cryptographic identifiers that correspond to wallet addresses. You can find your public key in your wallet settings. We'll automatically register any new public keys when creating the multisig."

    icon: Users,
    question: "What happens after creation?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>After creating your multisig:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-sm">
